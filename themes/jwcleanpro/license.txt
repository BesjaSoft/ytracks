Removing the link and template sponsor
If you don't want to link back to joomlaweb.com, you can always pay a link removal donation fee of 20 USD. This will allow you to use the template link free on one domain name. Also, kindly send me the site's url so I can include it on my list of verified users
You can send your payments through Paypal to this address: paypal@joomlaweb.com
